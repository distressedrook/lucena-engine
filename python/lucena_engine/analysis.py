"""The coach's grounded briefing — deterministic natural-language analysis.

`build_analysis(board, engine)` assembles ONE readable, number-bearing briefing
from all the raw calculated material: the engine eval, the material balance, the
five-term positional read, and the tactical fact sheet. It is *a function of the
raw facts* — no LLM in its production, same board ⇒ same briefing.

It is the coach's INPUT, not its output: the coach reads it to understand the
position, then interprets it into player-facing coaching (translating numbers to
meaning). So — unlike a beat — the briefing may carry things the coach must never
say aloud: centipawns, win%. It may be surfaced in the UI or not; that is a
display choice, not part of what it is.

Every line is one grounded statement in plain English (all White's point of view,
so the coach never has to flip perspective). The tactical facts arrive already in
natural language from the fact sheet; the positional standings already read as
sentences; this module stitches them into a briefing and prepends the eval.
